		h3 You are now starting Wes' Secret Mission!

		p This consists of a series of puzzles and codes that you will need to solve to figure out the Secret Message. You will work together with your fellow Agents to help each other reach the goal.

		p A few guidelines and tips:
		ol
			li Completing the mission requires teamwork and communication, so use the Group Chat to ask each other questions, pass information, and get to know each other along the way

			li There is a goal/prize at the end, but the point of this activity is to have fun, work together, and build relationships with one another

			li The first challenge is shared by all team members. However, all future challenges are specific to the individual. The concepts for each individual challenge are the same across the board, so if you need help on your individual challenge, ask your teammates!

			li This is not a race to see how fast one person can do it. Please respect those who work quickly and those who work slowly. More important than how quickly you solve each challenge (whether communal or individual) is getting participation and input from all members.

			li If you are one who enjoys problem solving and will work quickly, please be mindful of others who are not and don’t go spoiling how you solved it to everyone unless it’s wanted.

			li If you are one where puzzles and problem solving aren’t your thing, that’s ok too, but please still try to participate as much as you can. 

			li If you have any questions or need clarification, please feel free to ask me.

			li If the website goes down (which will probably happen at some point), please let me know as well

		p I tried to make it all pretty challenging, so hopefully you don’t get through it all in 15 minutes. But it shouldn’t take more than like a couple of hours of focused thinking. If you need help, ask someone (there are freaking 7 of you) or you can ask me for a hint if you all really need it.
